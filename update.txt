E-mail update@tidakada.com, enclose this:
- name of your website
- URL of your website
- a password (that will enable you to change the name of your site or its URL when you redesign/move)

Shortly after your e-mail, you'll receive an e-mail with your details and a unique ID (a long string of characters). This is your cafelogID, that you'll have to put in the config file like this:
$cafelogID ="myID";
(replace 'myID' with the cafelogID string that you received)
